my super mario world music projects

## Seriously? Super Mario World is like 30 years old, why would you make music for it?
Yes, Super Mario World (SMW) is indeed a game from 1990. But there is still today an active community around this masterpiece of video game history. In particular, there is a community which is devoted to creating new Super Mario World levels via manipulating ROM files (these are the files you use for playing SMW on a PC via an emulator). Since people don't want to use the same old songs all the time there are also many people creating new songs which can be used for these 'romhacks'.

I have been learning much about music theory and composition in the last 6 months. In order to get creative here, I decided to combine my passion for
 - one of my favourite SNES games
 - programming
 - composition
 
in order to create some SMW custom songs. My first goal was to get a song published on smwcentral.net, the main page for this community. I managed to do this with 'haunted house 2001', see song list below. I will keep composing according to my time and inspiration. Maybe, some day I'll have a song someone cosiders to use for a hack, that would be nice.

## Song list
### Published
 - *Haunted house 2001*: An unsettling piece for ghost houses and such. It's a bit weird and has some drawbacks. The beat and harmony is a bit naive and it's overall quite repetitive. However, I managed to achieve a qulity to get it published. I actually like the third section of it, maybe some day I'll create a new composition around it. Here you find the [Source](haunted_house_2001) and the [publication](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=22713) on smw central.

### In development
 - *Unnamed String quartet*: work in progress. A more conventional piece for strings. Intending to practice composition essentials. [Source.](unnamed_string_quartet)

Im also working on some shell scripts to simplfy the development part of composing SMW music here: https://github.com/wol-e/spc_tools

Work in progress and ambitioned: I also work on a programm to automatically generate the source file for an SMW song from a MIDI file here: https://github.com/wol-e/midi_to_spc_template
