my super mario world music projects

## Seriously? Super Mario World is like 30 years old, why would you make music for it?
Yes, Super Mario World (SMW) is indeed a game from 1990. But there is still today an active community around this masterpiece of video game history. In particular, there is a community which is devoted to creating new Super Mario World levels via manipulating ROM files (these are the files you use for playing SMW on a PC via an emulator). Since people don't want to use the same old songs all the time there are also many people creating new songs which can be used for the 'romhacks'.

I have been learning much about music theory and composition in the last 6 months. In order to get creative here, I decided to combine my passion for my 
 - favourite SNES game
 - programming
 - composition
 
in order to create some SMW custom songs. My goal is to get a song published on smwcentral, you can follow my progress here on the main page for this community:
